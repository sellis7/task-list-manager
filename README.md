## Task or To-Do List Manager
*Simple task list manager that stores data through use of creating a session*

##### General instructionsâ€“
Enter individual things that need to be dealt with or remembered, and hit "Add Task". Each new entry  
will be viewable in the drop-down menu, and can then be selected and deleted. When an entry is deleted,  
the remaining tasks will be renumbered, to maintain logical order. The entries will persist until all  
cookies have been deleted, or if browser settings destroy all cookies when quitting the browser application,  
the list will not hold the data.
